## Docker-compose:
#### run containers orchestration:
```
docker-compose up -d --build
```
#### stop containers orchestration:
```
docker-compose down --volumes
```


## Docker:
Use **Dockerfile1**

### build
```
docker build -f image/Dockerfile1 -t viix:22.04 .
```


### run
```
docker run -d --name new_container viix:22.04
```


### run with SSH
```
docker run -d --name new_container -p 2222:22 viix:22.04
```


### access into docker
```
winpty docker exec -it new_container bash
```


## stop all active containers
```
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```


## SSH:
### SSH status
```
service ssh status
```

Location, where all SSH keys are automatically generated by script **00_regen_ssh_host_keys.sh** (if SSH enabled):
```
cd /etc/ssh
```

SSH settings:
```
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```


<a name="enabling_ssh"></a>
#### Enabling SSH

Baseimage-docker disables the SSH server by default. Add the following to your Dockerfile to enable it:

    RUN rm -f /etc/service/sshd/down

    # Regenerate SSH host keys. baseimage-docker does not contain any, so you
    # have to do that yourself. You may also comment out this instruction; the
    # init system will auto-generate one during boot.
    RUN /etc/my_init.d/00_regen_ssh_host_keys.sh

Alternatively, to enable sshd only for a single instance of your container, create a folder with a [startup script](#running_startup_scripts).  The contents of that should be

    ### In myfolder/enable_ssh.sh (make sure this file is chmod +x):
    #!/bin/sh
    rm -f /etc/service/sshd/down
    ssh-keygen -P "" -t dsa -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key

Then, you can start your container with

    docker run -d -v `pwd`/myfolder:/etc/my_init.d my/dockerimage

This will initialize sshd on container boot.  You can then access it with the insecure key as below, or using the methods to add a secure key.  Further, you can publish the port to your machine with -p 2222:22 allowing you to ssh to 127.0.0.1:2222 instead of looking up the ip address of the container.

<a name="ssh_keys"></a>
#### About SSH keys

First, you must ensure that you have the right SSH keys installed inside the container. By default, no keys are installed, so nobody can login. For convenience reasons, we provide [a pregenerated, insecure key](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker/blob/master/image/services/sshd/keys/insecure_key) [(PuTTY format)](https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker/blob/master/image/services/sshd/keys/insecure_key.ppk) that you can easily enable. However, please be aware that using this key is for convenience only. It does not provide any security because this key (both the public and the private side) is publicly available. **In production environments, you should use your own keys**.

<a name="using_the_insecure_key_for_one_container_only"></a>
#### Using the insecure key for one container only

You can temporarily enable the insecure key for one container only. This means that the insecure key is installed at container boot. If you `docker stop` and `docker start` the container, the insecure key will still be there, but if you use `docker run` to start a new container then that container will not contain the insecure key.

Start a container with `--enable-insecure-key`:

    docker run YOUR_IMAGE /sbin/my_init --enable-insecure-key

Find out the ID of the container that you just ran:

    docker ps

Once you have the ID, look for its IP address with:

    docker inspect -f "{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}" <ID>

Now that you have the IP address, you can use SSH to login to the container, or to execute a command inside it:

    # Download the insecure private key
    curl -o insecure_key -fSL https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker/raw/master/image/services/sshd/keys/insecure_key
    chmod 600 insecure_key

    # Login to the container
    ssh -i insecure_key root@<IP address>

    # Running a command inside the container
    ssh -i insecure_key root@<IP address> echo hello world

<a name="enabling_the_insecure_key_permanently"></a>
#### Enabling the insecure key permanently

It is also possible to enable the insecure key in the image permanently. This is not generally recommended, but is suitable for e.g. temporary development or demo environments where security does not matter.

Edit your Dockerfile to install the insecure key permanently:

    RUN /usr/sbin/enable_insecure_key

Instructions for logging into the container is the same as in section [Using the insecure key for one container only](#using_the_insecure_key_for_one_container_only).

<a name="using_your_own_key"></a>
#### Using your own key

Edit your Dockerfile to install an SSH public key:

    ## Install an SSH of your choice.
    COPY your_key.pub /tmp/your_key.pub
    RUN cat /tmp/your_key.pub >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys && rm -f /tmp/your_key.pub

Then rebuild your image. Once you have that, start a container based on that image:

    docker run your-image-name

Find out the ID of the container that you just ran:

    docker ps

Once you have the ID, look for its IP address with:

    docker inspect -f "{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}" <ID>

Now that you have the IP address, you can use SSH to login to the container, or to execute a command inside it:

    # Login to the container
    ssh -i /path-to/your_key root@<IP address>

    # Running a command inside the container
    ssh -i /path-to/your_key root@<IP address> echo hello world




### What are the problems with the stock Ubuntu base image?

Ubuntu is not designed to be run inside Docker. Its init system, Upstart, assumes that it's running on either real hardware or virtualized hardware, but not inside a Docker container. But inside a container you don't want a full system anyway, you want a minimal system. But configuring that minimal system for use within a container has many strange corner cases that are hard to get right if you are not intimately familiar with the Unix system model. This can cause a lot of strange problems.

Baseimage-docker gets everything right. The "Contents" section describes all the things that it modifies.


### Why use baseimage-docker?
You can configure the stock ubuntu image yourself from your Dockerfile, so why bother using baseimage-docker?

Configuring the base system for Docker-friendliness is no easy task. As stated before, there are many corner cases. By the time that you've gotten all that right, you've reinvented baseimage-docker. Using baseimage-docker will save you from this effort.

* It sets up the base system correctly. Many people may not think so, but Unix has many corner cases caused by decades of cruft. Getting them wrong can result in very strange problems. This image does everything correctly. Learn more.⁠
* It reduces the time needed to run docker build, allowing you to iterate your Dockerfile more quickly.
* It reduces download time during redeploys. Docker only needs to download the base image once: during the first deploy. On every subsequent deploys, only the changes you make on top of the base image are downloaded.


## Contents

Baseimage-docker only contains essential components. Learn more about the rationale.⁠


**Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** as base system.

* A correct init process [learn more](https://blog.phusion.nl/2015/01/20/docker-and-the-pid-1-zombie-reaping-problem/).
* Fixes APT incompatibilities with Docker.
* syslog-ng.
* The cron daemon.
  * An optional SSH server (disabled by default), for those use cases where docker exec is inappropriate.
Password and challenge-response authentication are disabled by default. Only key authentication is allowed.
  * It allows an predefined key by default to make debugging easy. You should replace this ASAP. See instructions.
  * [Runit](https://smarden.org/runit) for service supervision and management.
